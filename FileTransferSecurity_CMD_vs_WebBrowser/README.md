# HTTP File Transfer: Modern Security Implications

Introduction

While working on the GoldenEye room on TryHackMe, I needed to transfer a file from my Kali VM to my host machine. Out of habit, I set up a simple Python HTTP server to serve the file. However, I quickly ran into an issue—Google Chrome outright blocked the download due to security policies.

This got me curious: Do all modern systems enforce this restriction, or does it only apply to browsers? I decided to test different methods and compare results.

Experiment: Testing Different Transfer Methods

I tested file downloads from an HTTP Python server using:

Google Chrome → Blocked.

Command Prompt (cmd) with wget → Allowed.

PowerShell with Invoke-WebRequest → Allowed.

Ubuntu WSL Terminal with wget → Allowed.

Despite Chrome enforcing strict security policies, CLI tools had no issue retrieving the file. This means that even though browsers are getting better at preventing unsafe downloads, alternative delivery methods still work.

Security Implications

For Pentesters & Attackers:

File delivery must be more sophisticated. Options include:

Phishing tactics to trick users into downloading files.

Leveraging command-line tools to bypass browser restrictions.

Setting up an HTTPS server instead of relying on plain HTTP.

Defensive Takeaways:

Enforce HTTPS for internal tools and file transfers where possible.

Monitor network traffic for unusual HTTP downloads, especially from CLI tools.

Apply endpoint protection that scans for potentially malicious files beyond browser-based protections.

Conclusion

This simple test highlights how security policies evolve over time. Browsers are stepping up defenses against unsafe downloads, but alternative methods still exist. Organizations should not only rely on browser security but also monitor network and endpoint activity to mitigate risks.
