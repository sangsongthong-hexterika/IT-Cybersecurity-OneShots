# Week 1: User Access & File Permissions

## üñ•Ô∏è Setting Up a Linux VM

I started off by setting up a new virtual machine using **VMware** with the **Ubuntu Server ISO** (`ubuntu-22.04.4-live-server-amd64.iso`). I chose a VM over WSL because **WSL lacks full Linux behavior**, especially around `systemd`, permissions, and service management.

> üîê Even with admin privileges, WSL is sandboxed under Windows and can't replicate real Linux environments. Trust me ‚Äî you don‚Äôt want to fight with those limitations while trying to simulate real system administration tasks.

### ‚úÖ VM Setup Steps

1. Download the Ubuntu Server ISO from [ubuntu.com](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
2. Create a new VM in VMware:
   + 2 CPUs, 4GB RAM, 20GB disk
   + Network: NAT
3. Mount ISO and install Ubuntu Server
   + Set hostname: `gexter-ubuntu-server`
   + Create user: `gexter`
   + Install **OpenSSH** during setup
4. Complete installation and reboot into the new system

The screenshot below show the completed installation.

### üîÑ First Boot Tasks

Before doing anything else

+ Run `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y` to get the latest packages
+ Install missing tools (optional): `htop`, `net-tools`, `vim`, etc.

### üì∏ Take a Snapshot

After setup and update, I took a **VM snapshot** and labeled it:
`Snapshot 1 - Freshly installed and updated`

This makes it easy to roll back if something breaks during experiments.

## üöÄ Jump Into the Lab

Now that the server is up, it's time to dive into Week 1 tasks: user management, permissions, and access control.

### Scenario Setting and Introduction

In this scenario, I am going to appoint myself as the sysadmin who is responsible to setup and manage the Ubuntu Server of a fictional company called Hexterika Vamps. This company sells vampire blood for healing people according the law of the Vampire Diaries that I had just finished watching last week. It's a fictional company so bare with me. I was going to make this company sells snake oil but it feels too cliche. The users came from any fictionals characters I have watched from TV Series and Anime.

Inside this company, there are 4 departments: IT, Sales & Marketing, Executives, Finance, and Legal.

| Department        | Users                                                 |
| :----------------:| :---------------------------------------------------: |
| IT                | Felicity Smoak, Charlie Bradberry, Toshiko Sato       |
| Executives        | Captain Jack Harkness, Chrollo Lucilfer, Marcel Gerad |
| Sales & Marketing | Lucifer Morningstar, Damon Salvatore, Hisoka Marrow   |
| Finance           | Klaus Mikealson, Caroline Forbs, Ianto Jones          |
| Legal             | Elijah Mikealson, Laura Lance, Crowley MacLeod        |

### Groups & Users Management

I created a new group using `groupadd` and `useradd`.
